# Modeling-the-impact-of-interventions-during-an-outbreak-of-HIV-infection-among-PWID
Abstract
Background
The largest recent HIV outbreak in People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) occurred in Athens, Greece in 2011-2013. In response, opioid substitution treatment (OST) and needle and syringe programs (NSP) were scaled-up and a seek-test-treat program was implemented. We aim to assess the impact of these interventions.
Methods 
A mathematical model of HIV transmission among PWID was calibrated to data available over time (2009-2013) on HIV prevalence, NSP/antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage and high-risk injection. A combined interventions scenario, including decrease in high-risk injection through linkage to OST and modification of risk behaviours and access to NSP and ART, was compared to a counterfactual scenario (no improvement at the levels of these interventions), with HIV incidence being the main outcome. 
Results
HIV incidence increased from <0.1 new cases/100 person-years in 2009 to 11.0 (95% CrI: 6.8,16.1) in 2012. Under both models, a subsequent decline was projected following early 2012, with incidence at the end of 2013 in the combined interventions scenario being lower by 77% compared to the counterfactual. The projected reduction in incidence under the intervention scenario was in agreement with empirical data. HIV prevalence would have escalated to 20.4% (95%CrI:16.9%,23.6%) in 2013 under the counterfactual scenario (vs. 16.8% (95%CrI:11.2%,23.0%) under the combined interventions scenario). In total, 31.4% of HIV cases (392) were averted over 2012-2013.
Conclusion
These results underline the importance of high-coverage harm reduction programs and of community-based interventions to rapidly reach PWID most in need.
